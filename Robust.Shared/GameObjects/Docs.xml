    <summary>
        Attempts to look up <typeparamref name="TComp1"/> on the given entity, writing it into the given space
        if it finds it and the space was not already empty.
    </summary>
    <remarks>
        This is preferable to
        <see cref="M:Robust.Shared.GameObjects.EntityQuery`1.TryComp(Robust.Shared.GameObjects.EntityUid,`0@)"/> if it
        is erroneous for the component to not be present, but you don't want to crash the game.<br/>
        This is also preferable if you may have already looked up the component, saving on lookup time.
