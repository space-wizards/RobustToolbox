    <remarks>
      It is strongly discouraged to ever construct inheritors of this interface manually, if you need a prototype that
      is also runtime-constructable data, consider moving all the data into its own class and using
      <see cref="T:Robust.Shared.Serialization.Manager.Attributes.IncludeDataFieldAttribute"/> to flatten it into
      the prototype class.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Prototypes should <b>never</b> be mutated at runtime, and should be treated as a read only source of truth. Keep
      in mind that for example reading a container like a list from the prototype does not make a copy, and you must do
      so yourself if you intend to mutate.
