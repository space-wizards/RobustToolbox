/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Asset passes are designed to be heterogeneously parallelizable.
/// This is accomplished through a thread-safe actor model.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Fundamentally, an asset pass accepts and sends files.
/// When pass A sends a file, it is handed off to any asset passes that have a dependency on pass A.
/// This is done in a fixed order,
/// where passes can "consume" the file to prevent it getting passed on to their siblings.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Consider a simple example with 4 passes:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>an input "pass" *that* just sends out all files we want to process.</item>
/// <item>an EOL-normalizing pass that converts the line endings of all text files to LF.</item>
/// <item>an RSI-packing pass that packs <c>.rsi/</c> bundles into single <c>.rsic</c> files.</item>
/// <item>an output pass that writes things to a zip file or something.</item>
/// </list>
/// To start, let's add a dependency from the output pass to the input pass.
/// This means that all files input just get sent straight to output. No fuss, no processing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// We then add the EOL conversion pass to also have a dependency on the input.
/// This pass "consumes" all text files like <c>.yml</c> or <c>.json</c>, but ignores files like <c>.png</c> or <c>.ogg</c>.
/// We specify the dependency to run before the output pass, so EOL conversion gets first dibs on any text files,
/// and gets to block them from being sent to the output pass unmodified.
/// Any files it does not care about it just ignores and they will be handled by the output pass.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The RSI-packing pass needs to be able to consume any files in a <c>.rsi/</c>, critically including the <c>.rsi/meta.json</c>.
/// Therefore we specify the dependencies such that RSI-pack goes before EOL.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// With this all set up, when a file gets sent by the input pass, the following happens, assuming the files don't get assumed:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>RSI-pass checks whether the file is part of a <c>.rsi</c></item>
/// <item>EOL pass checks whether the file is a text file</item>
/// <item>The file gets sent to output as fallback</item>
/// </list>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Of course, the output pass still needs a dependency on the EOL and RSI passes,
/// so their respective outputs don't get thrown into the void.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The RSI-packing pass needs to have a full view of the file list that comes in before it can process,
/// since each RSI is composed of multiple small files. <see cref="AcceptFile"/> alone would not be sufficient for this.
/// The solution is a special <see cref="AcceptFinished"/> signal, which is raised when all dependencies are also "finished"
/// (and therefore have sent out their full output of assets).
/// In the RSI case, <see cref="AcceptFile"/> would be used to keep track of all RSIs that have to be processed,
/// and <see cref="AcceptFinished"/> starts the actual work when all input files are accounted for.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This entire architecture is parallelized: sending and receiving of files happens from any thread.
/// Pass implementations that need to track state (like RSI packing) must be wary to properly lock their data.
/// Passes are encouraged to make good use of multithreading by using <see cref="RunJob"/> to thread-pool work.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>AssetPass</c> must be inherited to be able to accept files properly.
/// However, <see cref="InjectFile"/> and <see cref="InjectFinished"/> can be used
/// to externally inject into the graph (it has to start somewhere).
/// <see cref="FinishedTask"/> can be used to wait for the graph to finish processing.
/// This means even a plain unspecialized <c>AssetPass</c> instance can be a useful tool.
/// </para>
