### Other

* Physics contacts are now stored per-world rather than per-map. This allows the multi-threading to be applicable to every contact rather than per-map.
* Contacts will no longer implicitly be destroyed upon bodies changing maps.


## 0.77.0.1

### Bugfixes

* Fix AttachToGridOrMap not retaining an entity's map position.

## 0.76.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Physics contact multi-threading cvars have been removed as the parallelism is now handled by IParallelManager.

### New features

### Bugfixes

* Fix generic visualisers not working because of recent appearance system changes in v0.75.0.0
* Fix physics not working properly on moving grids (transform matrix deferral).

### Other

* Transform matrix dirtying is deferred again (undo change in v0.75.0.0
* Added two new serv3 analysers (NotNullableFlagAnalyzer and PreferGenericVariantAnalyzer)


## 0.75.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Changed default for `net.buffer_size` to `2`.
* Changed default for `auth.mode` to `Required`. On development builds, the default is overriden to remain at `Optional`, so this only affects published servers.
* The default value for the `outsidePrediction` argument of the `InputCmdHandler.FromDelegate()`  has changed from false to true.

### New features

## 0.74.0.0

### Breaking changes

* `ITypeReader<,>.Read(...)` and `ITypeCopier<>.Copy(...)` have had their `bool skipHook` parameter replaced with a `SerializationHookContext` to facilitate multithreaded prototype loading.
* Prototypes are now loaded in parallel across multiple threads. Type serializers, property setters, etc... must be thread safe and not rely on an active IoC instance.

### Bugfixes

* Mapped string serializer once again is initialized with prototype strongs, reducing bandwidth usage.

### Other

* Drastically improved startup time by running prototype loading in parallel.
  * `AfterDeserialization` hooks are still ran on the main thread during load to avoid issues.
* Various systems in the serialization system such as `SerializationManager` or `ReflectionManager` have had various methods made thread safe.
* `TileAliasPrototype` no longer has a load priority set.
* Straightened out terminology in prototypes: to refer to the type of a prototype (e.g. `EntityPrototype` itself), use "kind".
  * This was previously mixed between "type" and "variant".

### Internal

* `SpanSplitExtensions` has been taken behind the shed for being horrifically wrong unsafe code that should never have been entered into a keyboard ever. A simpler helper method replaces its use in `Box2Serializer`.
* `PrototypeManager.cs` has been split apart into multiple files.

## 0.73.0.0

### Breaking changes

* The entity lookup flag `LookupFlags.Anchored` has been replaced with `LookupFlags.Static`.
* We are now using **.NET 7**.
* `IDependencyCollection`/`IoCManager` `RegisterInstance` does not automatically add the instance to object graph, so `BuildGraph()` must now be called to see the new instances.
  * `deferInject` parameteres have been removed.

### New features

* The server will now check for any unknown CVars at startup, to possibly locate typos in your config file.
* `IDependencyCollection` is now thread safe.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed config files not being truncated before write, resulting in corruption.

### Other

* Removed some cruft from the `server_config.toml` default config file that ships with Robust.
* Most usages of x86 SIMD intrinsics have been replaced with cross-platform versions using the new .NET cross-platform intrinsics.
  * This reduces code to maintain and improves performance on ARM.
* Tiny optimization to rendering code.
* `RobustSerializer` no longer needs to be called from threads with an active IoC context.
  * This makes it possible to use from thread pool threads without `IoCManager.InitThread`.
* Removed finalizer dispose from `Overlay`.
* Stopped integration tests watching for prototype reload file changes, speeding stuff up.

### Internal

* Moved `SerializationManager`'s data definition storage over to a `ConcurrentDictionary` to improve GC behavior in integration tests.

## 0.72.0.0

### Breaking changes

* EntityPausedEvent has been split into EntityPausedEvent and EntityUnpausedEvent. The unpaused version now has information about how long an entity has been paused.

## 0.71.1.4

### Bugfixes

* Fixed CVars not being saved correctly to config file.

### Other

* Mark `validate_rsis.py` as `+x` in Git.
* Made config system more robust against accidental corruption when saving.

* RSIs with trailing commas in the JSON metadata are no longer allowed.

### Bugfixes

* `csi` doesn't throw a `NullReferenceException` anymore.

### Other

* The `game.maxplayers` CVar has been deprecated in favor of the new `net.max_connections` CVar. Functionality is the same, just renamed to avoid confusion. The old CVar still exists, so if `game.maxplayers` is set it will be preferred over the new one.
* The new default for `net.max_connections` is 256.
* Debug monitors (F3) now have margin between them.
* F3 (clyde monitor) now lists the windowing API and version in use.
* Added system monitor to F3 with various info like OS version, .NET runtime version, etc...
* The engine now warns when loading `.png` textures inside a `.rsi`. This will be blocked in the future.


## 0.70.0.0

### New features

* `game.desc` CVar for a server description to show in the launcher.
* New system for exposing links to e.g. a Discord in the launcher.
  * The engine does not have a built-in method for configuring these, but it does now have a `StatusHostHelpers.AddLink` method to correctly format these from content. The idea is that content wires the types of links (with icon names) up itself via `IStatusHost.OnInfoRequest`.
  * See also [the HTTP API documentation](https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/engine/http-api) for reference.
* `GameShared` now has a `Dependencies` property to allow access to the game's `IDependencyCollection`. This makes it possible to avoid using static `IoCManager` in `EntryPoint`-type content code.
* A new define constant `DEVELOPMENT` has been defined, equivalent to `!FULL_RELEASE`. See [the docs](https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/technical-docs/preprocessor-defines) for details.
* `IConfigurationManager` has new functions for reading and writing CVar directly from a TOML file `Stream`.
* New `IConfigurationManager.LoadDefaultsFromTomlStream` to load a TOML file as CVar default overrides.
* Added new serializers to support Queue<T> data-fields.
* Added a `FromParent()` function to `IDependencyCollection`, enabling dependencies to be passed to parallel threads.
* `IClientStateManager` now has a `PartialStateReset()` function to make it easier for content to rewind to previous game states.
* Added `IClientNetManager.DispatchLocalNetMessage()`, which allows a client to raise a local message that triggers networked event subscriptions.

### Bugfixes

* `IPlayerSession.OnConnect()` now actually gets called when players connect.
* `MapLoaderSystem.TryLoad(.., out rootUids)` now properly only returns entities parented to the map.

### Other

* Invalid placement types for the entity spawn menu now log warnings.
* Slightly improved sprite y-sorting performance.

### Internal

* The current physics map that an entity is on is now cached in the transform component alongside other cached broadphase data. This helps to fix some broadphase/lookup bugs.

## 0.69.0.0


## 0.68.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Updated yml schema validator to remove the `grids` node.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed position-less audio playing.

* Fix some merge artifacts from mapgrid support for maps.


## 0.67.1.0

### New features

- Maps can now have MapGridComponent added to them.

### Breaking changes

* MapGrid is deprecated and has been merged into MapGridComponent. This is subject to further changes as it gets ECSd more in future.
* The `grids` yaml node on map files is deprecated and has been merged onto MapGridComponent. Loading maps is backwards compatible for now but is subject to change in future. Saving maps will save in the new format.


## 0.66.0.0

### Breaking changes

* AudioSystem functions for playing audio have changed. Functions that take in filters now require an additional argument that will determine whether sounds are recorded by replays. Additionally, there are several new overrides that take in a recipient session or entity.

### Bugfixes

* Script globals for C# interactive were not having dependencies injected correctly.
* GetWorldPosition() now returns the correct positions even prior to transform initialization.
* Fix map loading not properly offsetting some entities that were directly parented to the map.

### Internal

### Bugfixes

* Fix physics testbeds.
* Force grids to always be collidable for now and stop them clipping.

### Other

* Slight optimization to `OutputPanel`'s handling of internal `RichTextEntry`s.
* Force non-collidable contacts to be destroyed. Previously these hung around until both entities became collidable again.

### Internal

* `Tools/version.py` has been updated to automatically update `RELEASE-NOTES.md`.
* General cleanup to `Tools/version.py`.

## 0.64.1.0

### Bugfixes

* Word-wrapping in `OutputPanel` and `RichTextLabel` has been fixed.

## 0.64.0.0

### Breaking changes

* IMapLoader has been refactored into MapLoaderSystem. The API is similar for now but is subject to change in the future.

## 0.63.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Thanks to new IME support with SDL2, `IClyde.TextInputStart()` and `IClyde.TextInputStop()` must now be appropriately called to start/stop receiving text input when focusing/unfocusing a UI control. This restriction is applied even on the (default) GLFW backend, to enforce consistent usage of these APIs.
* `[GUI]TextEventArgs` have been renamed to `[GUI]TextEnteredEventArgs`, turned into records, and made to carry a `string` rather than a single text `Rune`.
* IoC and `DependencyCollection` `Register` methods now have a `TInterface : class` constraint.
* [ABI] `IoCManager.InitThread` now returns the `IDependencyCollection`.

### New features

* Fixes for compiling & running on .NET 7. You'll still have to edit a bunch of project files to enable this though.
* `FormattedMessage.EnumerateRunes()`
* `OSWindow.Shown()` virtual function for child classes to hook into.
* `IUserInterfaceManager.DeferAction(...)` for running UI logic "not right now because that would cause an enumeration exception".
* New `TextEdit` control for multi-line editable text, complete with word-wrapping!
* `Rope` data structure for representing large editable text, used by the new `TextEdit`.
* Robust now has IME support matching SDL2's API. This only works on the SDL2 backend (which is not currently enabled by default) but the API is there:
    * `IClyde.TextInputStart()`, `IClyde.TextInputStop()`, `IClyde.TextInputSetRect()` APIs to control text input behavior.
    * `TextEditing` events for reporting in-progress IME compositions.
    * `LineEdit` and `TextEdit` have functional IME support when the game is running on SDL2. If you provide a font file with the relevant glyphs, CJK text input should now be usable.
* `Register<T>` (single type parameter) extension method for `IDependencyCollection`.

### Bugfixes

* Fixes erroneous literal "\\n" inside the Clyde debug panel.
* Fixed Lidgren connection status changes potentially getting mislogged.
* Fixed missing components not being correctly saved for maps
* Fixed map saving sometimes not including new components.
* Fix hot reload unit tests.

### Other

* Properly re-use `HttpClient` in `NetManager` meaning we properly pool connections to the auth server, improving performance.
* Hub advertisements have extended keep-alive pool timeout, so the connection can be kept active between advertisements.
* All HTTP requests from the engine now have appropriate `User-Agent` header.
* `bind` command has been made somewhat more clear thanks to a bit of help text and some basic completions.
* `BoundKeyEventArgs` and derivatives now have a `[DebuggerDisplay]`.
* Text cursors now have a fancy blinking animation.
* `SDL_HINT_MOUSE_FOCUS_CLICKTHROUGH` is set on the SDL2 windowing backend, so clicking on the game window to focus it will pass clicks through into the game itself, matching GLFW's behavior.
* Windows clipboard history paste now works.
* Improved multi-window UI keyboard focusing system: a single focused control is now tracked per UI root (OS window), and is saved/restored when switching between focused window. This means that you (ideally) only ever have a UI control focused on the current OS window.

### Internal

* `uitest2` is a new command that's like `uitest` but opens an OS window instead. It can also be passed an argument to open a specific tab immediately.
* Word-wrapping logic has been split off from `RichTextEntry`, into a new helper struct `WordWrap`.
* Some internal logic in `LineEdit` has been shared with `TextEdit` by moving it to a new `TextEditShared` file.
* SDL2 backend now uses `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` instead of `GetFunctionPointerForDelegate`-style P/Invoke marshalling.
* Entity prototype reloading logic has been moved out of `PrototypeManager` and into a new `PrototypeReloadSystem`.
* Most usages of `IoCManager.` statically have been removed in favor of dependency injection.

## 0.62.1.0

### Bugfixes

* Fixed a PVS issue causing entities to be sent to clients without first sending their parents.
* Improved client-side state handling exception tolerance.

### Other

* Fixes a broad-phase bug were entities were not properly updating their positions.

### Other

* Added the LocalizedCommands class, which automatically infer help and description loc strings from the commands name.

## 0.61.0.0

### Breaking changes

* IMap and IMapGrid have been removed. Just use the associated components directly.

### Other

* AudioSystem has been refactored.

## 0.60.0.0

### Breaking changes

* ISerializationHooks.BeforeSerialization() has been removed. Use custom type serializers instead.

### New features

* Added function to UserInterfaceSystem that returns list of BUIs that a client has open.

### Bugfixes

### Other

* Component.Owner is now marked as obsolete.

## 0.57.0.4

### Bugfixes

* Made entity deletion more resilient against exceptions. Should fix several bugs.

## 0.57.0.2 and 0.57.0.3

### Bugfixes

* Fixed more entity-lookup bugs.

## 0.57.0.1

### Bugfixes

* Fixed entity lookup bug that was causing crashes.

### 0.57.0.0

### Breaking changes

* EntityLookupComponent has been merged into BroadphaseComponent. The data that was previously stored in this tree is now stored across the 3 trees on BroadphaseComponent.

### New features

* EntityLookup has had its flags updated to reflect the merge of EntityLookupComponent and BroadphaseComponent, with the new flags reflecting each tree: Dynamic, Static, and Sundries. Dynamic and Static store physics bodies that are collidable and Sundries stores everything else (apart from grids).

### Internal

* EntityLookup and Broadphase have had their data de-duplicated, dropping the AABBs stored on the server by half. This also means MoveEvent updates will be much faster.
* PVS mover updates has had their performance improved slightly.
* Physics LinkedList nodes for contacts will no longer be re-made for every contact and will just be cleared when re-used.
* Sprite / Light dynamictree allocations on the client have been dropped by using static lambdas.

### Other

* Significantly reduce physics contact allocations.

## 0.55.4.1

### Breaking changes

* Removed `SI`, `SIoC`, `I`, `IoC`, `SE` and `CE` VV command prefixes.
  * `SI`, `SIoC`, `I` and `IoC` are replaced by VV paths under `/ioc/` and `/c/ioc/`.
  * `SE` and `CE` are replaced by VV paths under `/system/` and `/c/system`.

### New features

* Added CVars to control Lidgren's <abbr title="Maximum Transmission Unit">MTU</abbr> parameters:
  * `net.mtu`
  * `net.mtu_expand`
  * `net.mtu_expand_frequency`
  * `net.mtu_expand_fail_attempts`
* Added a whole load of features to ViewVariables.
  * Added VV Paths, which allow you to refer to an object by a path, e.g. `/entity/1234/Transform/WorldPosition`
  * Added VV Domains, which allow you to add "handlers" for the top-most VV Path segment, e.g. `/entity` is a domain and so is `/player`...
  * Added VV Type Handlers, which allow you to add "custom paths" under specific types, even dynamically!
  * Added VV Path networking, which allows you to read/write/invoke paths remotely, both from server to client and from client to server.
  * Added `vvread`, `vvwrite` and `vvinvoke` commands, which allow you to read, write and invoke VV paths.
  * Added autocompletion to all VV commands.
  * Please note that the VV GUI still remains the same. It will be updated to use these new features in the future.

### Other

* Changed Lidgren to be compiled against `net6.0`. This unlocks `Half` read/write methods.
* Lidgren has been updated to [0.2.2](https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network/blob/v0.2.2/RELEASE-NOTES.md). Not all the changes since 0.1.0 are new here, since this is the first version where we're properly tracking this in release notes.
* Robust.Client now uses our own [NFluidsynth](https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.NFluidsynth) [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpaceWizards.NFluidsynth).

### Internal

* Renamed Lidgren's assembly to `SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network`.
* Rogue `obj/` folders inside Lidgren no longer break the build.
* Renamed NFluidsynth's assembly to `SpaceWizards.NFluidsynth`
