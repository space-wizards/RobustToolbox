Robust Toolbox is a client/server backend for [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14).

### *This repository is the *engine* section of SS14. This is the base engine all SS14 servers will be built on. As such, it does not start on its own: it needs the [content repo](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14). Use said repo for actual development, even if you're modifying the engine itself.*
