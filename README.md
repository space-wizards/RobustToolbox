![Robust Toolbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/space-wizards/asset-dump/3dd3078e49e3a7e06709a6e0fc6e3223d8d44ca2/robust.png)

Robust Toolbox is an engine primarily being developed for [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14), although we're working on making it usable for both [singleplayer](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolboxTemplateSingleplayer) and [multiplayer](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolboxTemplate) projects.

Use the [content repo](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) for actual development, even if you're modifying the engine itself.

## Documentation/Wiki

The [HackMD Wiki](https://hackmd.io/@ss14/docs/wiki) has documentation on SS14s content, engine, game design and more. We also have lots of resources for new contributors to the project.

## Contributing

We are happy to accept contributions from anybody. Get in Discord or IRC if you want to help. We've got a [list of issues](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox/issues) that need to be done and anybody can pick them up. Don't be afraid to ask for help either!

## Building

This repository is the **engine** part of SS14. It's the base engine all SS14 servers will be built on. As such, it does not start on its own: it needs the [content repo](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14). Think of Robust Toolbox as BYOND in the context of Spacestation 13.
