## 224.0.1

### Bugfixes

* Fixes PVS throwing exceptions when invalid entities are passed to `ExpandPvsEvent`. Now it just logs an error.
* Fixes BUIs not properly closing, resulting in invalid entities in `UserInterfaceUserComponent.OpenInterfaces`
* Fixes an unknown/invalid prototype exception sometimes being thrown when running ``IPrototypeManager.ResolveResults()`


## 224.0.0

### Breaking changes

* `Matrix3` has been replaced with `System.Numerics.Matrix3x2`. Various Matrix related methods have been turned into extension methods in the `Matrix3Helpers` class.
* Engine `EntityCategory` prototype IDs have been changed to use CamelCase. I.e., `hideSpawnMenu` -> `HideSpawnMenu`
* Prototypes can now be implicitly cast `ProtoId<T>` or `EntProtoId` ID structs. The new implicit cast might cause previous function calls to be ambiguous.

### New features

* `Array.Clear(Array)` is now available in the sandbox.
* BUIs now use `ExpandPvsEvent`. I.e., if a player has a UI open, then the entity associated with that UI will always get sent to the player by the PVS system.
* Added `cvar_subs` command for listing all subscribers to cvar changes
* Entity categories have been reworked
  * Each category now has a `HideSpawnMenu` field. The old `HideSpawnMenu` category is now just a normal category with that field set to true.
  * Reworked category inheritance. Inheritance can now be disabled per category using a `Inheritable` field.
  * Entity prototypes can now be automatically added to categories based on the components that they have, either by specifying components when defining the category in yml, or by adding the EntityCategoryAttribute to the component class.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed client-side BUI error log spam if an unknown entity has a UI open.
* Fixed placement manager spawning entities with incorrect rotations.

### Other

* Added a try-catch block to BUI constructors, to avoid clients getting stuck in error loops while applying states.
* Attempting to play sounds on terminating entities no longer logs an error.


## 223.3.0

### New features

* Better exception logging for IRobustJob.
* Add SetGridAudio helper for SharedAudioSystem.

### Bugfixes

* Fix placement manager not setting entity rotation correctly.
* Fix grid-based audio not playing correctly.


## 223.2.0

### New features

* Added several new `FormattedMessage` methods for better exception tolerance when parsing markup. Several existing methods have been marked as obsolete, with new renamed methods taking their place.


## 223.1.2

### Bugfixes

* `MapGridComponent.LastTileModifiedTick` is now actually networked to clients.


## 223.1.1

### Bugfixes

* Fixed an exception caused by enum cvars using integer type values instead of enum values


## 223.1.0

### Other

* Various `ContainerSystem` methods have been obsoleted in favour of overrides that take in an `Entity` struct instead of `EntityUid`
* Various `EntityCoordinates` methods have been obsoleted with replacements added  to `SharedTransformSystem`


## 223.0.0

### Breaking changes

* The `ComponentState` class is now abstract. Networked components that don't have state information now just return a null state.
* The way that delta component states work has changed. It now expects there to be two different state classes, only one of which should implement `IComponentDeltaState<TFullState>`

### New features

* A new `replay.checkpoint_min_interval` cvar has been added. It can be used to limit the frequency at which checkpoints are generated when loading a replay.
* Added `IConfigurationManager.OnCVarValueChanged`. This is a c# event that gets invoked whenever any cvar value changes.

### Bugfixes

* `IEyeManager.GetWorldViewbounds()` and `IEyeManager.GetWorldViewbounds()` should now return the correct bounds if the main viewport does not take up the whole screen.

### Other

* The default values of various replay related cvars have been changed to try and reduce memory usage.


## 222.4.0

### New features

* Added the following types from `System.Numerics` to the sandbox: `Complex`, `Matrix3x2`, `Matrix4x4`, `Plane`, `Quaternion`, `Vector3`, `Vector4`.


## 222.3.0

### New features

* `ITileDefinition.EditorHidden` allows hiding a tile from the tile spawn panel.
* Ordered event subscriptions now take child types into account, so ordering based on a shared type will work.

### Bugfixes

* Cross-map BUI range checks now work.
* Paused entities update on prototype reload.

### Other

* Fixed build compatibility with .NET 8.0.300 SDK, due to changes in how Central Package Management behaves.
* Physics component has delta states to reduce network usage.


## 222.2.0

## 222.1.0

### New features

* Added `BoundKeyEventArgs.IsRepeat`.
* Added `net.lidgren_log_warning` and `net.lidgren_log_error` CVars.

### Bugfixes

* Fix assert trip when holding repeatable keybinds.

### Other

* Updated Lidgren to v0.3.1. This should provide performance improvements if warning/error logs are disabled.


## 222.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Mark IComponentFactory argument in EntityPrototype as mandatory.

### New features

* Add `EntProtoId<T>` to check for components on the attached entity as well.

### Bugfixes

* Fix PVS iterating duplicate chunks for multiple viewsubscriptions.

### Other

* Defer clientside BUI opens if it's the first state that comes in.


## 221.2.0

### New features

* Add SetMapAudio helper to SharedAudioSystem to setup map-wide audio entities.
* Add SetWorldRotNoLerp method to SharedTransformSystem to avoid client lerping.

### Bugfixes

* `SpriteComponent.CopyFrom` now copies `CopyToShaderParameters` configuration.


## 221.1.0


## 221.0.0

### Breaking changes

* `EntParentChangedMessage.OldMapId` is now an `EntityUid` instead of `MapId`
* `TransformSystem.DetachParentToNull()` is being renamed to `DetachEntity`
* The order in which `MoveEvent` handlers are invoked has been changed to prioritise engine subscriptions

### New features

* Added `UpdateHovered()` and `SetHovered()` to `IUserInterfaceManager`, for updating or modifying the currently hovered control.
* Add SwapPositions to TransformSystem to swap two entity's transforms.

### Bugfixes

* Improve client gamestate exception tolerance.

### Other

* If the currently hovered control is disposed, `UserInterfaceManager` will now look for a new control, rather than just setting the hovered control to null.

### Internal

* Use more `EntityQuery<T>` internally in EntityManager and PhysicsSystem.


## 220.2.0

### New features

* RSIs can now specify load parameters, mimicking the ones from `.png.yml`. Currently only disabling sRGB is supported.

* Added a new `CopyToShaderParameters` system for `SpriteComponent` layers.


## 220.1.0

### Bugfixes

* Fix client-side replay exceptions due to dropped states when recording.

### Other

* Remove IP + HWId from ViewVariables.
* Close BUIs upon disconnect.


## 220.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Refactor UserInterfaceSystem.
  - The API has been significantly cleaned up and standardised, most noticeably callers don't need to worry about TryGetUi and can rely on either HasUi, SetUiState, CloseUi, or OpenUi to handle their code as appropriate.
  - Interface data is now stored via key rather than as a flat list which is a breaking change for YAML.
  - BoundUserInterfaces can now be completely handled via Shared code. Existing Server-side callers will behave similarly to before.
  - BoundUserInterfaces now properly close in many more situations, additionally they are now attached to the entity so reconnecting can re-open them and they can be serialized properly.


## 219.2.0

### New features

* Add SetMapCoordinates to TransformSystem.
* Improve YAML Linter and validation of static fields.

### Bugfixes

* Fix DebugCoordsPanel freezing when hovering a control.

### Other

* Default hub address (`hub.hub_urls`) has been changed to `https://hub.spacestation14.com/`.


## 218.0.0

### Breaking changes

* `Robust.Shared.Configuration.EnvironmentVariables` is now internal and no longer usable by content.

### New features

* Add TryGetRandom to EntityManager to get a random entity with the specified component and TryGetRandom to IPrototypeManager to return a random prototype of the specified type.
* Add CopyData to AppearanceSystem.
* Update UI themes on prototype reloads.
* Allow scaling the line height of a RichTextLabel.
* You can now specify CVar overrides via environment variable with the `ROBUST_CVAR_*` prefix. For example `ROBUST_CVAR_game__hostname=foobar` would set the appropriate CVar. Double underscores in the environment variable name are replaced with ".".
* Added non-generic variant of `GetCVar` to `IConfigurationManager`.
* Add type tracking to FieldNotFoundErrorNode for serialization.
* Distance between lines of a `RichTextLabel` can now be modified with `LineHeightScale`.

### Bugfixes

* Fix `MapComponent.LightingEnabled` not leaving FOV rendering in a broken state.

### Internal

* `Shuffle<T>(Span<T>, System.Random)` has been removed, just use the builtin method.


## 217.0.0

### Breaking changes

* TransformSystem.SetWorldPosition and SetWorldPositionRotation will now also perform parent updates as necessary. Previously it would just set the entity's LocalPosition which may break if they were inside of a container. Now they will be removed from their container and TryFindGridAt will run to correctly parent them to the new position. If the old functionality is desired then you can use GetInvWorldMatrix to update the LocalPosition (bearing in mind containers may prevent this).

### New features

* Implement VV for AudioParams on SoundSpecifiers.
* Add AddUi to the shared UI system.

### Bugfixes

* Fix the first measure of ScrollContainer bars.


## 216.0.0

### Breaking changes

* The `net.low_lod_distance` cvar has been replaced with a new `net.pvs_priority_range`. Instead of limiting the range at which all entities are sent to a player, it now extends the range at which high priorities can be sent. The default value of this new cvar is 32.5, which is larger than the default `net.pvs_range` value of 25.

### New features

* You can now specify a component to not be saved to map files with `[UnsavedComponent]`.
* Added `ITileDefinitionManager.TryGetDefinition`.
* The map loader now tries to preserve the `tilemap` contents of map files, which should reduce diffs when re-saving a map after the game's internal tile IDs have changed.

### Bugfixes

* Fix buffered audio sources not being disposed.


## 215.3.1

### Bugfixes

* Revert zstd update.


## 215.3.0

### New features

* Added `PlacementInformation.UseEditorContext`.
* Added `Vector2Helpers` functions for comparing ranges between vectors.

### Bugfixes

* `Texture.GetPixel()`: fixed off-by-one with Y coordinate.
* `Texture.GetPixel()`: fix stack overflow when reading large images.
* `Texture.GetPixel()`: use more widely compatible OpenGL calls.

### Other

* Disabled `net.mtu_expand` again by default, as it was causing issues.
* Updated `SharpZstd` dependency.


## 215.2.0

### New features

* Implement basic VV for SoundSpecifiers.

### Bugfixes


## 215.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Update Lidgren to 0.3.0

### New features

* Made a new `IMetricsManager` interface with an `UpdateMetrics` event that can be used to update Prometheus metrics whenever they are scraped.
  * Also added a `metrics.update_interval` CVar to go along with this, when metrics are scraped without usage of Prometheus directly.
* IoC now contains an `IMeterFactory` implementation that you can use to instantiate metric meters.
* `net.mtu_ipv6` CVar allows specifying a different MTU value for IPv6.
* Allows `player:entity` to take a parameter representing the player name.
* Add collection parsing to the dev window for UI.
* Add a debug assert to Dirty(uid, comp) to catch mismatches being passed in.

### Bugfixes

* Support transform states with unknown parents.
* Fix serialization error logging.
* Fix naming of ResizableMemoryRegion metrics.
* Fix uncaught overflow exception when parsing NetEntities.

### Other

* The replay system now allows loading a replay with a mismatching serializer type hash. This means replays should be more robust against future version updates (engine security patches or .NET updates).
* `CheckBox`'s interior texture is now vertically centered.
* Lidgren.Network has been updated to [`v0.3.0`](https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network/blob/v0.3.0/RELEASE-NOTES.md).
* Lowered default IPv4 MTU to 900 (from 1000).
* Automatic MTU expansion (`net.mtu_expand`) is now enabled by default.

### Internal

* Cleanup some Dirty component calls internally.


## 214.2.0

### New features

* Added a `Undetachable` entity metadata flag, which stops the client from moving an entity to nullspace when it moves out of PVS range.

### Bugfixes

* Fix tooltips not clamping to the left side of the viewport.
* Fix global audio property not being properly set.

### Internal

* The server game state / PVS code has been rewritten. It should be somewhat faster now, albeit at the cost of using more memory. The current engine version may be unstable.


## 214.1.1

### Bugfixes

* Fixed connection denial always causing redial.


## 214.1.0

### New features

* Added the `pvs_override_info` command for debugging PVS overrides.

### Bugfixes

* Fix VV for prototype structs.
* Fix audio limits for clientside audio.


## 214.0.0

### Breaking changes

* `NetStructuredDisconnectMessages` has received a complete overhaul and has been moved to `NetDisconnectMessage`. The API is no longer designed such that consumers must pass around JSON nodes, as they are not in sandbox (and clunky).

### New features

* Add a basic default concurrent audio limit of 16 for a single filepath to avoid overflowing audio sources.
* `NetConnectingArgs.Deny()` can now pass along structured data that will be received by the client.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed cursor position bugs when an empty `TextEdit` has a multi-line place holder.
* Fixed empty `TextEdit` throwing exception if cursor is moved left.


## 213.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Remove obsoleted BaseContainer methods.

### New features

* Add EntityManager.RaiseSharedEvent where the event won't go to the attached client but will be predicted locally on their end.
* Add GetEntitiesInRange override that takes in EntityCoordinates and an EntityUid hashset.

### Bugfixes

* Check if a sprite entity is deleted before drawing in SpriteView.


## 212.2.0

### New features

* Added an Enlarged method for Box2Rotated.

### Internal

* Significantly optimise ChunkEnumerator / FindGridsIntersecting in certain use cases by intersecting the grid's AABB with the local AABB to avoid iterating dummy chunks.


## 210.1.1

### Bugfixes

* Fixed multiple recent bugs with key binding storage.

### Other

* Change default of `ButtonGroup.IsNoneSetAllowed` to `true`. This makes it default again to the previous (unintentional) behavior.


## 210.1.0

### New features

* `NetUserId` implements `ISelfSerialize` so can be used in data fields.
* `ButtonGroup.IsNoneSetAllowed` to allow a button group to have no buttons pressed by default.


## 210.0.3

### New features

* Controls can now hook before, after, and during rendering of their children.
* IRenderHandle is now a public API, with the caveat that it's properties and methods are unstable.
* ButtonGroup now exposes what buttons it contains, alongside which is currently pressed.
* OptionButton has additional styleclasses, and has a hook for modifying it's internal buttons.
* PanelContainer.GetStyleBox() is now protected rather than private.
* TextureButton now uses a TextureRect instead of custom drawing code.
* TextureRect has additional style properties exposed.
    * A new property, TextureSizeTarget, was added, which allows specifying a size in virtual pixels that the control should attempt to draw at.
    * Stretch mode is now a style property.
    * Scale is now a style property.
* Avalonia.Metadata.XmlnsDefinitionAttribute is now permitted by the sandbox.
* Add MaxDimension property to Box2 to return the higher of the Width or Height.
* Add GetLocalPosition to convert ScreenCoordinates to coordinates relative to the control. Ignores window.
* Add GlobalRect and GlobalPixelRect for controls to get their UIBox2i in screen terms.
* Add dotted line drawing to DrawingHandleScreen.
* You can use `Subs.CVar()` from an entity systems to subscribe to CVar changes. This is more convenient than `IConfigurationManager.OnValueChanged` as it automatically unsubscribes on system shutdown.
* There is now a built-in type serializer for `DateTime`, so you can put `DateTime`s in your data fields.
* `System.Text.Unicode.UnicodeRange` and `UnicodeRanges` are now available in the sandbox.

### Bugfixes

* UI drawing now properly accounts for a control's draw routine potentially mangling the current matrix.
* UI roots now properly update when the global stylesheet is changed. They previously only did so if they had a dedicated stylesheet (which is the one case where they would be unaffected by a global sheet update.


## 209.0.1

### Bugfixes

* Fix missed import from 209.0.0.


## 209.0.0

* Remove obsolete CoordinatesExtension for ToEntityCoordinates from GridUid / Vector2i.

### New features

* Add GetEntitiesOnMap / GetChildEntities to EntityLookupSystem to return components on the specified map and components with the specified parent respectively.
* Add MaxDimension property to Box2 to return the higher of the Width or Height.
* Add GetLocalPosition to convert ScreenCoordinates to coordinates relative to the control. Ignores window.
* Add GlobalRect and GlobalPixelRect for controls to get their UIBox2i in screen terms.
* Add dotted line drawing to DrawingHandleScreen.
* `IConfigurationManager.LoadDefaultsFromTomlStream` properly does type conversions. This fixes scenarios like loading of `long` CVars.
* Add helper methods for TileRef / Vector2i to SharedMapSystem for ToCenterCoordinates (tile center EntityCoordinates) and ToCoordinates (tile origin to EntityCoordinates).
* Copy some of the coordinates extensions to SharedTransformSystem.

### Bugfixes

* Fixed integer overflows in replay max size calculation.
* Explicitly capped `replay.replay_tick_batchSize` internally to avoid high values causing allocation failures.

### Other

* Important MIDI performance improvements.


## 208.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Metadata flags are no longer serialized as they get rebuilt on entity startup.

### Bugfixes

* Log failing to load user keybinds and handle the exception.


## 207.1.0

### New features

* Add the ability to merge grids via GridFixtureSystem.


## 207.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Update EntityLookup internally so non-approximate queries use the GJK solver and are much more accurate. This also means the approximate flag matters much more if you don't need narrowphase checks.
* Add shape versions of queries for both EntityLookup and MapManager.

### Bugfixes

* Fix PVS full state updates not clearing session entities and causing exceptions.

### Other

* Integration tests now run `NetMessage`s through serialization rather than passing the objects between client and server. This causes tests that missed `[NetSerializer]` attributes on any objects that need them to fail.

### Internal

* Remove a lot of duplicate code internally from EntityLookup and MapManager.


## 206.0.0

### Breaking changes

* tpto will teleport you to physics-center instead of transform center instead.

* The project now uses [Central Package Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/consume-packages/central-package-management).
* (Almost) all the NuGet packages have been updated. This causes many problems. I am so sorry.
* Cleaned up some unused packages as well.


## 204.1.0

### New features

* New `EntitySystem` subscription helper for working with Bound User Interface events. You can find them by doing `Subs.BuiEvents<>()` in a system.
* The `EntityManager.Subscriptions` type (for building helper extension methods) now uses

### Bugfixes

### Breaking changes

* `IComponentFactory.RegisterIgnore()` no longer supports overwriting existing registrations, components should get ignored before they are registered.
* Event bus subscriptions are now locked after `IEntityManager` has started, instead of after the first component gets added. Any event subscriptions now need to happen before startup (but after init).
* Event bus subscriptions must now be locked before raising any events.
* Delete FodyWeavers.xsd as it hasn't been used for a long time.
* Remove physics sleep cancelling as it was, in hindsight, a bad idea.

### New features

* The `game.maxplayers` CVar has been deprecated in favor of the new `net.max_connections` CVar. Functionality is the same, just renamed to avoid confusion. The old CVar still exists, so if `game.maxplayers` is set it will be preferred over the new one.
* The new default for `net.max_connections` is 256.
* Debug monitors (F3) now have margin between them.
* F3 (clyde monitor) now lists the windowing API and version in use.

* New system for exposing links to e.g. a Discord in the launcher.
  * The engine does not have a built-in method for configuring these, but it does now have a `StatusHostHelpers.AddLink` method to correctly format these from content. The idea is that content wires the types of links (with icon names) up itself via `IStatusHost.OnInfoRequest`.
  * See also [the HTTP API documentation](https://docs.spacestation14.io/en/engine/http-api) for reference.
* `GameShared` now has a `Dependencies` property to allow access to the game's `IDependencyCollection`. This makes it possible to avoid using static `IoCManager` in `EntryPoint`-type content code.

## 0.66.0.0

### Breaking changes

* AudioSystem functions for playing audio have changed. Functions that take in filters now require an additional argument that will determine whether sounds are recorded by replays. Additionally, there are several new overrides that take in a recipient session or entity.

### Bugfixes

* Script globals for C# interactive were not having dependencies injected correctly.
* GetWorldPosition() now returns the correct positions even prior to transform initialization.
* Fix map loading not properly offsetting some entities that were directly parented to the map.

### Internal

* Added lookup/broadphase re-parenting tests.


## 0.65.2.1

### Bugfixes

* Fix empty MetaData components being serialized to map files.
* Fix saving a grid as a map not marking it as pre-mapinit.

### Other

* Rename transform lerping properties alongside other minor internal changes.

### Bugfixes

* Fix physics testbeds.
* Force grids to always be collidable for now and stop them clipping.

### Other

* Slight optimization to `OutputPanel`'s handling of internal `RichTextEntry`s.
* Force non-collidable contacts to be destroyed. Previously these hung around until both entities became collidable again.

### Internal

* `Tools/version.py` has been updated to automatically update `RELEASE-NOTES.md`.
* General cleanup to `Tools/version.py`.

## 0.64.1.0

### Bugfixes

* Word-wrapping in `OutputPanel` and `RichTextLabel` has been fixed.

## 0.64.0.0

### Breaking changes

* IMapLoader has been refactored into MapLoaderSystem. The API is similar for now but is subject to change in the future.

## 0.63.0.0

### Breaking changes

* Thanks to new IME support with SDL2, `IClyde.TextInputStart()` and `IClyde.TextInputStop()` must now be appropriately called to start/stop receiving text input when focusing/unfocusing a UI control. This restriction is applied even on the (default) GLFW backend, to enforce consistent usage of these APIs.
* `[GUI]TextEventArgs` have been renamed to `[GUI]TextEnteredEventArgs`, turned into records, and made to carry a `string` rather than a single text `Rune`.
* IoC and `DependencyCollection` `Register` methods now have a `TInterface : class` constraint.
* [ABI] `IoCManager.InitThread` now returns the `IDependencyCollection`.

### New features

* Fixes for compiling & running on .NET 7. You'll still have to edit a bunch of project files to enable this though.
* `FormattedMessage.EnumerateRunes()`
* `OSWindow.Shown()` virtual function for child classes to hook into.
* `IUserInterfaceManager.DeferAction(...)` for running UI logic "not right now because that would cause an enumeration exception".
* New `TextEdit` control for multi-line editable text, complete with word-wrapping!
* `Rope` data structure for representing large editable text, used by the new `TextEdit`.
* Robust now has IME support matching SDL2's API. This only works on the SDL2 backend (which is not currently enabled by default) but the API is there:
    * `IClyde.TextInputStart()`, `IClyde.TextInputStop()`, `IClyde.TextInputSetRect()` APIs to control text input behavior.
    * `TextEditing` events for reporting in-progress IME compositions.
    * `LineEdit` and `TextEdit` have functional IME support when the game is running on SDL2. If you provide a font file with the relevant glyphs, CJK text input should now be usable.
* `Register<T>` (single type parameter) extension method for `IDependencyCollection`.

### Bugfixes

* Fixes erroneous literal "\\n" inside the Clyde debug panel.
* Fixed Lidgren connection status changes potentially getting mislogged.
* Fixed missing components not being correctly saved for maps
* Fixed map saving sometimes not including new components.
* Fix hot reload unit tests.

### Other

* Properly re-use `HttpClient` in `NetManager` meaning we properly pool connections to the auth server, improving performance.
* Hub advertisements have extended keep-alive pool timeout, so the connection can be kept active between advertisements.
* All HTTP requests from the engine now have appropriate `User-Agent` header.
* `bind` command has been made somewhat more clear thanks to a bit of help text and some basic completions.
* `BoundKeyEventArgs` and derivatives now have a `[DebuggerDisplay]`.
* Text cursors now have a fancy blinking animation.
* `SDL_HINT_MOUSE_FOCUS_CLICKTHROUGH` is set on the SDL2 windowing backend, so clicking on the game window to focus it will pass clicks through into the game itself, matching GLFW's behavior.
* Windows clipboard history paste now works.
* Improved multi-window UI keyboard focusing system: a single focused control is now tracked per UI root (OS window), and is saved/restored when switching between focused window. This means that you (ideally) only ever have a UI control focused on the current OS window.

### Internal

* `uitest2` is a new command that's like `uitest` but opens an OS window instead. It can also be passed an argument to open a specific tab immediately.
* Word-wrapping logic has been split off from `RichTextEntry`, into a new helper struct `WordWrap`.
* Some internal logic in `LineEdit` has been shared with `TextEdit` by moving it to a new `TextEditShared` file.
* SDL2 backend now uses `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` instead of `GetFunctionPointerForDelegate`-style P/Invoke marshalling.
* Entity prototype reloading logic has been moved out of `PrototypeManager` and into a new `PrototypeReloadSystem`.
* Most usages of `IoCManager.` statically have been removed in favor of dependency injection.

## 0.62.1.0

### Bugfixes

* Made entity deletion more resilient against exceptions. Should fix several bugs.

## 0.57.0.2 and 0.57.0.3

### Bugfixes

* Fixed more entity-lookup bugs.

## 0.57.0.1

### Bugfixes

* Fixed entity lookup bug that was causing crashes.

### 0.57.0.0

### Breaking changes

* EntityLookupComponent has been merged into BroadphaseComponent. The data that was previously stored in this tree is now stored across the 3 trees on BroadphaseComponent.

### New features

* EntityLookup has had its flags updated to reflect the merge of EntityLookupComponent and BroadphaseComponent, with the new flags reflecting each tree: Dynamic, Static, and Sundries. Dynamic and Static store physics bodies that are collidable and Sundries stores everything else (apart from grids).

### Internal

* EntityLookup and Broadphase have had their data de-duplicated, dropping the AABBs stored on the server by half. This also means MoveEvent updates will be much faster.
* PVS mover updates has had their performance improved slightly.
* Physics LinkedList nodes for contacts will no longer be re-made for every contact and will just be cleared when re-used.
* Sprite / Light dynamictree allocations on the client have been dropped by using static lambdas.
* The physics contact buffer for each FixtureProxy is now pooled.

  * Added VV Paths, which allow you to refer to an object by a path, e.g. `/entity/1234/Transform/WorldPosition`
  * Added VV Domains, which allow you to add "handlers" for the top-most VV Path segment, e.g. `/entity` is a domain and so is `/player`...
  * Added VV Type Handlers, which allow you to add "custom paths" under specific types, even dynamically!
  * Added VV Path networking, which allows you to read/write/invoke paths remotely, both from server to client and from client to server.
  * Added `vvread`, `vvwrite` and `vvinvoke` commands, which allow you to read, write and invoke VV paths.
