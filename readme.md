# Space Station 14 [![Master Fork status](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Silvertorch5/space-station-14/branch/master) 


Space Station 14 is a renewed attempt at an SS13 remake.

The original sprites for the game, created by Adam Riches, have been withheld for use in a future project at his discretion. The original sprites have been replaced with placeholder images.
