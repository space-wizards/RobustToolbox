    PJB3005 (2024-08-24)
    So the reason that Robust.Client.Injectors is NS2.0 is that Visual Studio 
    still ships a .NET FX based MSBuild for some godforsaken reason. This means 
    that when having Robust.Client.Injectors loaded directly by the main MSBuild 
    process... that would break.

    Except we don't do that anyways right now due to file locking issues, so maybe 
    it's fine to give up on that. Whatever.
